# CODETECH-TASK-1

Here’s a comprehensive description of the NLP task, including your introduction:

Introduction
Manasa Pyaram is working on a natural language processing (NLP) task under the mentorship of N. Santosh, as part of a project for CodTech. This task demonstrates a deep understanding of the machine learning and deep learning concepts applied to NLP problems, showcasing proficiency in Python and related frameworks.

Description of the NLP Task
Libraries and Tools:

Data Handling: The task uses pandas and numpy for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
Algorithms:
Traditional Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVC), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB), and XGBoost for classification tasks.
Deep Learning: Sequential models built with Keras, including LSTM and GRU layers for handling sequence data.
Preprocessing:
TfidfVectorizer and CountVectorizer for feature extraction from text.
Dimensionality reduction with TruncatedSVD for improving computational efficiency.
Optimization:
GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
EarlyStopping to enhance model performance by avoiding overfitting.
NLP-Specific Utilities:
Tokenization and stopword removal using NLTK.
Goals of the Task:
The primary aim is to build an NLP pipeline capable of processing text data for applications such as:

Text Classification (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis)
Sentiment Analysis
Topic Modeling
Pipeline Overview:

Feature Extraction:
Text data is converted into numerical representations using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer.
Dimensionality Reduction:
TruncatedSVD is applied to manage large feature spaces.
Modeling:
Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and deep learning architectures (LSTM, GRU) are implemented for training on the processed data.
Evaluation:
GridSearchCV ensures the best hyperparameters are selected, and metrics are used to evaluate model performance.
Preprocessing:
The script preprocesses raw text data with:

Tokenization: Splitting sentences into words using word_tokenize.
Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words using NLTK’s English stopwords list.
Neural Network Specifics:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors.
Dropout and Batch Normalization: Improves model stability and prevents overfitting.
Sequential Layers: LSTM and GRU for understanding temporal relationships in text data
